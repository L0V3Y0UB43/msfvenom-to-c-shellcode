This python script formats the shellcode that is created by msfvenom.

It only works on the shellcode that looks like.

```
"\x4d\x72\x20\x50\x6f\x6f\x70\x79\x42\x75\x74\x68\x6f\x6c\x65\x0a"
"\x4d\x72\x20\x50\x6f\x6f\x70\x79\x42\x75\x74\x68\x6f\x6c\x65\x0a"
"\x4d\x72\x20\x50\x6f\x6f\x70\x79\x42\x75"
```

The output will be
```
unsigned char rawShellcode[] = {
	0x4d, 0x72, 0x20, 0x50, 0x6f, 0x6f, 0x70, 0x79, 0x42, 0x75, 0x74, 0x68, 0x6f, 0x6c, 0x65, 0x0a,
	0x4d, 0x72, 0x20, 0x50, 0x6f, 0x6f, 0x70, 0x79, 0x42, 0x75, 0x74, 0x68, 0x6f, 0x6c, 0x65, 0x0a,
	0x4d, 0x72, 0x20, 0x50, 0x6f, 0x6f, 0x70, 0x79, 0x42, 0x75
};
```
